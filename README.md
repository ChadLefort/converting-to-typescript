# Coverting to Typescript

This is the project used for a presentation on coverting your app to typescript for the Mandeville Web Development Meetup.

Slides for presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a89X1Q2LgwzHnacwJiFmnLR68DmgsFVGx-6Vf0QgOzE/edit#slide=id.p).

## How To:

To run the examples use ts-node

```
ts-node examples\classes-interfaces.ts
ts-node examples\enums.ts
ts-node examples\generics.ts
```

You can read more about ts-node [here](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node).

To run the web app

```
npm i -g yarn
yarn start
```

The webapp was built using [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript) and [redux](http://redux.js.org/).
